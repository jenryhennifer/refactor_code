CSS HTML GitHub GitLab

**Description**

In this project we took an original piece of code and refactored with semantic elements as well as editing mistakes made.

To start I changed the title of the webpage from Welcome to Horiseon to make it more specific. 

Semantic Elements Used | Reasoning
------------ | -------------
header  | to define the header of the page
nav | navigation bar at the top
figure | representing photos used
article | defining the wording next to the image
section | separating each section of the page
aside | separating the side bar from the rest of the content
footer | define the footer of the page including the copyright and final statement


When div was changed to nav the div defined in the CSS file needed to be changed to nav to apply the stylesheet to the proper section of the page. An ID needed to be added to the section "search-engine-optimization" to allow the variable in the navigation bar to be clickable like the others. 

I removed the terminating bracket on line 89 since an img doesn't need it. 

Every image needed an alt tag to allow contet if the image doesn't load or if it's being read on a text reader.
